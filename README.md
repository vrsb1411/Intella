While shopping across different supermarkets, most of us experience pricing differences for identical products. Most supermarkets already have online websites on which prices in-store are presented.

For now, consumers can search for the grocery prices online before heading out to purchase at the supermarket. However, researching across different supermarkets can be time-consuming, but saves money.

Is there a way to automate the comparison process in the backend, and present the different pricing comparisons in a clear and transparent manner for consumers? We will try to build a website that tackles these pain points, helping consumers save money and time.

Presenting Intella Web, created using BeautifulSoup4, SQlite3 & Flask to bring a faster and cheaper way to get deals.
